AI-safe CLI for AI agents. Earl sits between your agent and external
services, ensuring secrets stay in the OS keychain, requests follow reviewed
templates, and outbound traffic obeys egress rules.

## Why

AI agents with shell or network access can read secrets in plaintext and make
arbitrary API calls. Earl eliminates that risk:

- Agents run `earl call provider.command --param value` instead of raw `curl`
- Secrets are stored in the OS keychain and injected at request time
- Every request is defined by an HCL template that can be reviewed ahead of time
- Outbound traffic is restricted via `[[network.allow]]` egress rules
- Private IPs are blocked to prevent SSRF
- Bash and SQL execution runs in a sandbox

## Quick Start

Prompt your coding agent:

```
Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brwse/earl/main/skills/getting-started-with-earl/SKILL.md
and any files it references under
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brwse/earl/main/skills/getting-started-with-earl/references/
then follow the skill to help me get started with Earl.
```

Your agent will install Earl, walk you through setup, and build your first template — all from a single prompt.

Or do it manually:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brwse/earl/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
# Or: cargo install earl

# Import a pre-built template (25 providers available: stripe, slack, github, notion, openai, ...)
earl templates import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brwse/earl/main/examples/stripe.hcl
earl secrets set stripe.api_key
earl call stripe.list_customers

# Or start with the no-auth system example
earl templates import ./examples/bash/system.hcl
earl call system.disk_usage --path /tmp
```

Templates are HCL files that define commands, parameters, and protocol
operations:

```hcl
version = 1
provider = "system"

command "disk_usage" {
  title       = "Check disk usage"
  summary     = "Reports disk usage for a given path"
  description = "Runs du -sh in a sandboxed bash environment."

  param "path" {
    type     = "string"
    required = true
  }

  operation {
    protocol = "bash"

    bash {
      script = "du -sh {{ args.path }}"
      sandbox {
        network = false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
